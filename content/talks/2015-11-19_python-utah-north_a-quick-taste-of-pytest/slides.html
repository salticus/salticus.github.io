# Testing in Python

It is more fun to write tests on a weekday than it is to look for bugs during the weekend.

## Thinking about programs in different ways.

Tests help you think about your code in specific ways.

They 
- invite you to keep your code decoupled (generally a good practice)
- run your code in new ways
- help other programmers understand where to hook into your code

Automated tests help you

- decrease time to run tests
- make sure you don't break something while fixing a bug


???

(That's probably too general an approach, as you'll shortly see.)
---

### Thinking about programs in different ways.

How many ways can python interpret the following program?

```
# hello.py
def greet(msg="Students and professionals, good evening!"):
    "Print a greeting to standard output"
    print(msg)
```

---

### Python's standard library

The Python standard library has at least **twelve** modules to interpret code. 

1. pydoc
1. pdb
1. profile
1. unittest
1. doctest
1. tabnanny
1. trace
1. py_compile
1. compileall
1. dis
1. tokenize
1. ast

Let's look at a few of these in action.

### Thinking about programs in different ways

```
# hello.py
def greet(msg="Students and professionals, good evening!"):
    "Print a greeting to standard output"
    print(msg)
```
---
### #1 pydoc generates documentation from source code

```bash

*$ python -m pydoc hello.py

Help on module hello:

NAME
    hello

FILE
    /home/buckles/Documents/learn/python/hello.py

FUNCTIONS
    hello()
        Print a greeting to standard output

$
```

---
### #2 pdb provides a debugging REPL

REPL: Read-Evaluate-Print Loop

```bash
*$ python -m pdb hello.py
> /home/buckles/Documents/learn/python/hello.py(2)<module>()
-> def greet():
(Pdb) list
  1     # hello.py
  2  -> def greet():
  3         "Print a greeting to standard output"
  4         print("Students and professionals, good evening!")
  5
  6     def test_hello():
  7         # how do we check IO?
  8         greet()
  9
 10     if "__main__" == __name__:
 11         greet()
(Pdb)
```

???
REPL: Read-Evaluate-Print Loop
Python allows us to drop into the repl and run more commands after executing this program.

---

### #3 profile measures the time spent in each function call

```bash
*$ python -m profile hello.py
Students and professionals, good evening!
       4 function calls in 0.001 seconds

    Ordered by: standard name

    ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
    1    0.001    0.001    0.001    0.001 :0(setprofile)
    1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 hello.py:2(<module>)
    1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 hello.py:2(greet)
    1    0.000    0.000    0.001    0.001 profile:0(<code object <module> at 0x7f7cade89a30, file "hello.py", line 2>)
    0    0.000             0.000          profile:0(profiler)
```
???
If this is a wildly successful hello world program, then perhaps we'll want to optimize.

---
### #4 unittest looks for tests to run

```bash

$ python -m unittest hello

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 0 tests in 0.000s

OK
$
```

(This would be more interesting if there was a test to run.)

???
Whoops, no tests in that code though.

# Pytest: a small taste

- discovery
- detailed error output
- parametrization

---
class: center, middle
### Pytest discovery: if the name starts with "test_" pytest runs it.
---

### test discovery (i.e. let pytest figure out what needs to run)

```
# hello.py
def greet(who="Students and professionals"):
    "Create a greeting"
    return "{}, good evening!".format(who)


*def test_hello():
    greeting = greet()
    assert greeting == "Students and professionals, good evening!"


if "__main__" == __name__:
    greet()
```

```
*$ pytest hello.py
=============================== test session starts ================================
platform linux2 -- Python 2.7.6 -- py-1.4.27 -- pytest-2.6.3
plugins: capturelog
collected 1 items

hello.py .

============================= 1 passed in 0.02 seconds =============================
$
```

---

### If the file name begins with "test_", then pytest runs it automagically

```
*# test_hello.py
def greet(who="Students and professionals"):
    "Create a greeting"
    return "{}, good evening!".format(who)


*def test_hello():
    greeting = greet()
    assert greeting == "Students and professionals, good evening!"


if "__main__" == __name__:
    greet()
```

```bash
*$ pytest

```
Hey, look, now that our tests are in `test_hello.py` pytest can find it without being told what file to look in!

### Parametrizing tests

Let's put our code and tests in separate modules.

```
*# hello.py
def greet(who="Students and professionals"):
    "Create a greeting"
    return "{}, good evening!".format(who)

if "__main__" == __name__:
    greet()
```

```
*# test_hello.py

import pytest
import hello

*@pytest.mark.parametrize('who', 'Boss')
def test_hello(who):
    greeting = hello.greet(who)
    assert greeting == "{}, good evening!".format(who)
```

---

```
$ pytest -v

```

Whoops. Forgot that strings act as lists of letters.
---

Let's try that again with a real list this time.
```
 # test_hello.py
 
 import pytest
 import hello
 
 
*@pytest.mark.parametrize('who', [
*            "Ladies and gentlemen",
*            "Students and professionals",
*            "Hackers and engineers"])
 def test_greet(who):
     greeting = hello.greet(who)
     assert greeting == "{}, good evening!".format(who)
```

---

```

That looks more like it.
