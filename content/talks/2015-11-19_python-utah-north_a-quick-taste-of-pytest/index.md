# A Quick Taste of Pytest

This talk was originally given in 2015. Some things should be updated. The first things come to mind are 

  - python 2 -> 3
  - py.test -> pytest

It demonstrates that Pytest, like many modules in Python, is an independent interpreter of Python code that does things not usually possible in the standard Python interpreter.
