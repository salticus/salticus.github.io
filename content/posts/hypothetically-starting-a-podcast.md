# Starting a Podcast

To podcast you need to do three things:

  1. Create content
  2. Host that content on the web
  3. Cultivate an audience 

## Recording content

Two pieces here: recording and content. The content piece you must figure out on your own. I'll provide advice on a basic recording setup, drawn second hand from the internet.


### Recording

Wisdom:

Use a simple editing tool.
- Record into Audacity. It's free, simple, and it will do the job.

Get a good recording of your voice.
- Get a dynamic USB microphone. ~$70-$120 range

Do not record anything else
- Cut out background noise: Do your recording in a clothing closet or under a blanket at a quiet time of day.
- Do not use speakers. They will be picked up by the mic. Use over-ear headphones to monitor the podcast.

Keep dialogue matched up.

If a guest is remote, do three tracks:
  1. Record your own audio.
  2. Record their audio separately.
  3. Have the guest record their own audio.

Use your recording of the guest to align their recording in post production. Their recording will sound better than an audio signal that's been compressed for an internet meeting tool.


#### Post production

This goes for remote guests, too.

## Host content on the web

You must upload your files somewhere, and your audience must download it from somewhere too.

Lots of options.
