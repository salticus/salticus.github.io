# Learning Strategies #

## Asking Questions

- [Short Self Contained Compilable Example](http://www.sscce.org/) (While this is addressed at Java audience, the principle applies to programming questions in general.)

- [Asking Questions the Smart Way](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) is a classic article that has been kept up to date.


## Mentored Learning

- [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org/) is a crowd-sourced mentoring platform. Learn by doing small coding exercises, then improve the solution with help from a live mentor. Note: that the name is spelled like "exercise" as in "coding EXERCISe Mentoring."


## Structured Learning

- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) provides free access to university level classes. Classes include videos, TAs and online forums. There are many other [MOOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MOOC_providers)s to check out. Some examples:
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) is aimed at K-12, which means it is very approachable if you are starting off fresh on a topic.
- [MIT Open Course Ware](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) has excellent content in the format of videos and PDFs.
- [edX](https://www.edx.org/)


## Spaced Repetition

- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) automates reviewing old topics.


## Exploring Small Examples

- [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) is a [code playground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_online_source_code_playgrounds#Online_web_client-side_source_code_playgrounds). Work backwards from a working product to learn how the pieces are put together.
- [Replit](https://replit.com/signup) is an online editor. Like Code Sandbox, it makes it easier to play with small examples.
