# Learning to Program

For general purpose programming there are a *lot* of good resources
online. 

Languages and resources to check out

- [Scratch][scratch_homepage] is a fun, graphical language aimed at school kids.
  Creating animations and sounds is easy, and kids (and adults) learn
  a lot.
- [Python][learn_python_the_hard_way] is a great general purpose language. (I use it every day.)
- [C][learn_c_the_hard_way] is an imperative language that is old, but still used everywhere.
- [Java][java_oracle_tutorials] is an object oriented language used by big corporations. It's very well documented.
- [Racket][racket_with_pictures] is a functional language aimed at teaching college students.
  Like Scratch it's easy to use, emphasizes things you can see
  (initially,) and teaches important concepts.

## Start with Python and [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) 

Setting things up takes some effort, but it's worth sticking with it. Zed
will step you through everything you need to do.

If you get discouraged with setting up Python, [download
Racket][racket_download] and do the [Introduction to
Racket with Pictures][racket_with_pictures].

Note: a coworker warns me that Zed (the author of "the hard way"
websites) cusses a lot when he lectures. The website uses clean 
language, so perhaps the videos do too, but I've never
watched them. The written tutorials were plenty for me.


## Online resources by category


### Python

General purpose language.

I use this one daily at work and for many personal projects.

Found on all major Linux systems. (That includes [Raspbian](http://www.raspbian.org/) for the Raspberry Pi.)

Can also install/run on windows.

### [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)

Graphical language aimed at kids.

A kid presented on Scratch at OpenWest last year. He had a surprisingly good understanding of programming principles.

Can use online after registering.

Can also download for learning offline.

### Racket

Functional Programming language.

For something fun to play around with, check out the [Introduction with Pictures].

This probably is the fastest to get started with: their installer is
just click and go no matter your system.

### C

Procedural language. High level language compared to assembly. 

Is what Linux is written in.

Is not C++. 

Has a good "Learn C the Hard Way" course http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/ (Recommended.)

### Java

Object Oriented Programming language.

Is *not* Javascript.

Tutorials to walk you through the language.

The [eclipse editor][eclipse_download] is a popular editor for Java.

Watch [MIT Introduction to Programming with Java][mit_intro_java] if you prefer lectures to reading.

### For questions

- check out http://stackoverflow.com/ 
- email me. I am more than happy to help. 
- do what the professionals do: grab a stuffed animal and explain your
  code to it. If this sounds odd, see [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging). Also watch Castaway and note the role that Wilson plays in the film.
