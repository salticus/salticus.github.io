<h1 id="a-quick-taste-of-pytest">A Quick Taste of Pytest</h1>
<p>This talk was originally given in 2015. Some things should be updated. The first things come to mind are </p>
<ul>
<li>python 2 -&gt; 3</li>
<li>py.test -&gt; pytest</li>
</ul>
<p>It demonstrates that Pytest, like many modules in Python, is an independent interpreter of Python code that does things not usually possible in the standard Python interpreter.</p>
