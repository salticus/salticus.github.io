<h1 id="starting-a-podcast">Starting a Podcast</h1>
<p>To podcast you need to do three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create content</li>
<li>Host that content on the web</li>
<li>Cultivate an audience </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="recording-content">Recording content</h2>
<p>Two pieces here: recording and content. The content piece you must figure out on your own. I'll provide advice on a basic recording setup, drawn second hand from the internet.</p>
<h3 id="recording">Recording</h3>
<p>Wisdom:</p>
<p>Use a simple editing tool.</p>
<ul>
<li>Record into Audacity. It's free, simple, and it will do the job.</li>
</ul>
<p>Get a good recording of your voice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Get a dynamic USB microphone. ~$70-$120 range</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not record anything else</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut out background noise: Do your recording in a clothing closet or under a blanket at a quiet time of day.</li>
<li>Do not use speakers. They will be picked up by the mic. Use over-ear headphones to monitor the podcast.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep dialogue matched up.</p>
<p>If a guest is remote, do three tracks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Record your own audio.</li>
<li>Record their audio separately.</li>
<li>Have the guest record their own audio.</li>
</ol>
<p>Use your recording of the guest to align their recording in post production. Their recording will sound better than an audio signal that's been compressed for an internet meeting tool.</p>
<h4 id="post-production">Post production</h4>
<p>This goes for remote guests, too.</p>
<p>TODO insert pics of podcasters set up in closets. (NYT</p>
<h2 id="host-content-on-the-web">Host content on the web</h2>
<p>You must upload your files somewhere, and your audience must download it from somewhere too.</p>
<p>Lots of options.</p>
